# Classifition_models_accuracy_testing
* Aim : To test the accuracy of the models of classification on the data_set of breast cancer paitent.

- We have a data_set around 600 of breast cancer paitent based on feature or attritube we group them in category they come.
- our main aim is to test the accuracy so we have taken data_set already pre-processed or refined data_set ready to be trained.
- we have different Classifition models and we have used same confusion metrics and accuracy functions on all of these model.

* Models and their ConfusionMetrics and Accuracy.
    - LogisticRegression           > [[103 4] [5 54]] acc= 0.9473
    - SVM                          > [[102 5] [5 59]] acc= 0.9415
    - K-NN                         > [[103 4] [5 59]] acc= 0.9473
    - kernel SVM model             > [[102 5] [3 61]] acc= 0.9532
    - Naive Bayes                  > [[99 8] [2 62]]  acc= 0.9415
    - Decision Tree Classification > [[103 4] [3 61]] acc= 0.9590
    - Random Forest Classification > [[102 5] [6 58]] acc= 0.9356

  * So the hightest accuracy on this particular data set amoung these models is Decision Tree Classification.
